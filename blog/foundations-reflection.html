    <ol>
      <li>Things I learnt about myself and my ego through core learning</li>
      <p> The top three things I have leart from core is Neuroplasticity, Growing Mindset, and Empathy. I believe these
        three core concept will help me continuouly growing as a programmer.
        <ol>
          <li>The Neuroplasticity of individual means that one's brain is malleable,  and It helps people to learn new things, to adapt environmental changes through building connection between neural cells.</li>
          <li>Individuals with a growing mindset believe they capability are not limited by talent and intelligence, and they can learn new skills through dedication.</li>
          <li>Empathy is fundamental skills that I need in the funture collabrating with others, when having daily communication and doing projects together with others, empathy is key that can make the communication authentic. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <li>The role of value, empathy and self-awareness in programming</li>
      <p>
        For me I value kindness, and integrity, when working and living in this world, it also applie in programming. There will be dilemma and situation that challenge my eithcs.
         With integrity, kindness, I can make optimum choice that benift the team. While I alread talked about empathy in the last question.
        Self-awareness is a skill that reflext ones Emotional Intelligence. Firt of all self-awareness can assist me enter ther folow when programming, it can boost the coding efficiency. Besides that, 
        programmer may encouner numbers of challenges and feeling frustration. Self-awareness can help individual sense the feeling, so they can apply positive strategies to tackle the negative ones.
         
      </p>
      <li>What has surprised me the most through core learning</li>
      <p>
        The concepts of Neuroplasticity is quite new to me, knowing these concepts helped me build up confidence on going through this journey. Through doing reflections, I have had better understanding 
        about myself, my stength, my weakness, they are all part of me. Through core learning, I adapt mind that I need to take most advantage of my strengths, and avoid my weakness block my way.
      </p>
      <li>My oppinion about why the bootcamp strongly emphasize on core learning </li>
      <p>I have shared about this to my friends and my previous co-workers at education sector, they all loved this idea. My previous manager said that it is really to see the conceps of mindfullness crossover 
        between different industry. Some of my friends who are experiences programmer highly agree that human skills and EQ are essential for job hunting. And for me I trust EDA that its goal is get me prepared 
        for the future employment.
      </p>
      <li>Have I spent too much time on core learning? Shoud I invest more time on practising coding instead of core learning?</li>
      <p>I do not think I am wasting my time doing core learning. I believe no mater what job do I do, one of the ultimate goals of life is about self-exploration, spending time on this sector
        do help every aspect of my life and my work. It helped me balance work and life better, it helped me to build authentic relationship with other, this is more important than improving 
        tech skills.
